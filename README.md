# Streamlit

My interactive Streamlit app that segments, labels, plots the mean intensity of segmented neurons with respect to image frames, and calculates various associated parameters typically designed for neuronal microscopy images, but should segment all distinct small round objects using Stardist model. 

Please type and execute "streamlit run ðŸ”¬_Preprocessing_and_Segmentation.py" in the terminal under the same directory where the file is to open the app after dependencies installation.
